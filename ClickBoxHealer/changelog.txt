**************** Working on for upcoming updates **********************
Re-arrange buff watch options so that you can keep the individual corner colors but set low duration colors
	--will take a little bit of time to untwist it's current setup
Create a cover for Offline,AFK,Warfront players


**************** TODOs - For long term updates *************************
Add a check to prevent new group members in a different zone/instance from showing offline.
	*also add an alternative for zoned members that says -1 or something when unavailable
Add options to change default debuff colors and default whitelist debuff color
Cleric Defiler Totem Solution: Create an empty frame if character is a cleric with a permanent mask to use for the totem
Add Raid debuff icon w/ options (size/move/etc)
Change the /cbh reset to not trigger until clicking the reloadui button.
	*Gives the user the ability to back out of it if they change their mind
Add more font options - different fonts, shadows/outlines, etc
Add link monitoring for clerics
	*They can have up to 4. Maybe line them up in a corner or something
	*Another possible option is to allow wildcards in the spell monitoring. Bond of * will search for any link from the cleric.
Add option to set player to be first in the group
	*Might also use this setting to organize the raid so that new people get batched on the end
Ability to display roles for just Tanks/Healers/Support individually
Add a copy keybind from ... function. Allowing similar/like specs to easily remain the same
Add an option to only toggle the frames while in a party
--Add an option to toggle showing party/raid leader. *Not possible at the moment
